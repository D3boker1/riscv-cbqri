=== Reporting Capacity and Bandwidth Controllers

The capability and bandwidth controllers that are present in the system should
be reported to operating systems using methods such as ACPI and/or device tree.
For each capacity and bandwidth controller, the following information should be
reported using these methods:

* Type of controller (for example, cache, interconnect, memory, and so on)
* Location of the register programming interface for the controller
* Placement and topology describing the hart and IO bridges that share the
  resources controlled by the controller
* The number of QoS identifiers supported by the controller
* For memory bandwidth controllers, the controlled memory regions. These regions might
  be described in the form of NUMA domains or proximity domains.
* If a controller is part of a set of controllers that collectively control a
  shared resource such as memory bandwidth of a memory region, then information
  to identify all members of the set should be reported.
* Constraints imposed by the controllers, such as the minimum number of capacity
  or bandwidth blocks per RCID.

=== Context Switching QoS Identifiers

Typically, the contents of the `srmcfg` CSR are updated with a new `RCID`
and/or `MCID` by the HS/S-mode scheduler if the `RCID` and/or `MCID` of the
new workload (a process or a VM) is not same as that of the previous workload.

A context switch usually involves saving the context associated with the
workload being switched away from and restoring the context of the workload
being switched to. Such a context switch might be invoked in response to an explicit
call from the workload (for example, as a function of an `ECALL` invocation) or can be
done asynchronously (for example, in response to a timer interrupt). In such cases the
scheduler might want to execute with the `srmcfg` configuration of the
workload being switched away from such that this execution is attributed to the
workload being switched away from and then prior to restoring the new workloads
context, first switch to the `srmcfg` configuration appropriate for the
workload being switched to such that all of that execution is attributed to
the new workload. Further in this context switch process, if the scheduler
intends some of its execution to be attributed to neither the outgoing
workload nor the incoming workload, then the scheduler might switch to a new
`srmcfg` configuration that is different from that of either of the workloads
for the duration of such execution.

=== QoS Configurations for Virtual Machines

Usually for virtual machines the resource allocations are configured by the
hypervisor. Usually the Guest OS in a virtual machine does not participate in
the QoS flows as the Guest OS does not know the physical capabilities of the
platform or the resource allocations for other virtual machines in the system.

If a use case requires it, a hypervisor might virtualize the QoS capability to a
VM by virtualizing the memory-mapped CBQRI register interface and virtualizing
the virtual-instruction exception on access to `srmcfg` CSR by the Guest OS.

[NOTE]
====
If the use of directly selecting among a set of `RCID` and/or `MCID` by a VM
becomes more prevalent and the overhead of virtualizing the `srmcfg` CSR using
the virtual instruction exception is not acceptable then a future extension can
be introduced where the `RCID`/`MCID` attempted to be written by VS mode are
used as a selector for a set of `RCID`/`MCID` that the hypervisor configures in
a set of HS mode CSRs.

=== QoS Identifiers for Supervisor and Machine Mode

The `RCID` and `MCID` configured in `srmcfg` also apply to execution in
S/HS-mode, but this is typically not an issue. Usually, S/HS-mode execution
occurs to provide services, such as through an ABI, to software executing at
lower privilege. Because the S/HS-mode invocation provides a service for
the lower privilege mode, the S/HS-mode software might not opt to modify the
`srmcfg` CSR.

Similarly, The `RCID` and `MCID` configured in `srmcfg` also apply to execution
in M-mode, but this is typically not an issue either. Usually, M-mode execution
occurs to provide services, such as through the SBI interface, to software
executing at lower privilege. Because the M-mode invocation provides a
service for the lower privilege mode, the M-mode software might not opt to modify
the `srmcfg` CSR.

If separate `RCID` and/or `MCID` are needed during software execution in
M/S/HS-mode, then the M/S/HS-mode software might update the `srmcfg` CSR and
restore it before returning to lower privilege mode execution. The statistical
nature of QoS capabilities means that the brief duration, such as the few
instructions in the M/S/HS-mode trap handler entry point, during which the trap
handler might execute with the `RCID` and/or `MCID` established for lower
privilege mode operation might not have a significant statistical impact.
