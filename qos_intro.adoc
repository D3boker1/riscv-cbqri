== Introduction

Quality of Service (QoS) is the minimal end-to-end performance that is
guaranteed in advance by a service level agreement (SLA) to a workload. The 
performance may be measured in the form of metrics such as instructions per
cycle (IPC), latency of servicing work, etc.

Various factors such as the available cache capacity, memory bandwidth,
interconnect bandwidth, CPU cycles, system memory, etc. affect the performance
in a computing system that runs multiple workloads concurrently. Further when
there is arbitration for shared resources, the prioritization of the workloads
requests against other competing requests may also affect the performance of
the workload. Such interference due to resource sharing may lead to
unpredictable workload performance cite:[PTCAMP].

When multiple workloads are running concurrently on modern processors with large
core counts, multiple cache hierarchies, and multiple memory controllers, the
performance of a workload becomes less deterministic or even non-deterministic
as the performance depends on the behavior of all the other workloads in the
machine that contend for the shared resources leading to interference. In many
deployment scenarios such as public cloud servers the workload owner may not be
in control of the type and placement of other workloads in the platform.

[NOTE]
====
A workload may be a single application, a group of application, a virtual
machine, a group of virtual machines, or some combination of above.
====

System software can control some of these resources available to the workload
such as the number of hardware threads made available for execution, the amount
of system memory allocated to the workload, the number of CPU cycles provided
for execution, etc. 

System software needs additional tools to control interference to a workload
and thereby reduce the variability in performance experienced by one workload
due to other workloadâ€™s cache capacity usage, memory bandwidth usage,
interconnect bandwidth usage, etc. through a resource allocation capability. The
resource allocation capability enables system software to reserve capacity
and/or bandwidth to meet the performance goals of the workload. Such controls
enable improving the utilization of the system by collocating workloads while
minimizing the interference caused by one workload to another cite:[HERACLES].

Effective use of the resource allocation capability requires hardware to provide
a resource monitoring capability by which the resource requirements of a
workload needed to meet a certain performance goal can be characterized. A
typical use model involves profiling the resource usage of the workload using
the resource monitoring capability and to establish resource allocations for the
workload using the resource allocation capability.

The allocation may be in the form of capacity or bandwidth depending on the type
of resource. For caches and directories, the resource allocation is in the form
of storage capacity. For interconnects and memory controllers the resource
allocation is in the form of bandwidth.

Workloads typically generate a different types of accesses to shared resources.
For example, some of the requests may be for accessing instructions and others
may be to access data operated on by the workload. Certain data accesses may
not have temporal locality whereas others may have a high probability of reuse.
In some cases it is desirable to provide differentiated treatment to each type
of access by providing unique resource allocation to each access type.

RISC-V Capacity and Bandwidth Controller QoS Register Interface (CBQRI) 
specification specifies:

. QoS identifiers to identify workloads that originate requests to the shared
  resources. These QoS identifiers include an identifier for resource allocation
  configuration and an identifier for the monitoring counters used to monitor
  resource usage. These identifiers accompany each request made by the workload
  to the shared resource. <<QOS_ID>> specifies the mechanism to associate the
  identifiers with workloads.
. Access-type identifiers to accompany request to access a shared resource to
  allow differentiated treatment of each access-type (e.g., code vs. data,
  etc.). The access-types are defined in <<QOS_ID>>
. Register interface for capacity allocation in capacity controllers such as
  shared caches and directories. The capacity allocation register interface is
  specified in <<CC_QOS>>.
. Register interface for capacity usage monitoring. The capacity usage
  monitoring register interface is specified in <<CC_QOS>>.
. Register interface for bandwidth allocation in bandwidth controllers such as
  interconnect and memory controllers. The bandwidth allocation register
  interface is specified in <<BC_QOS>>.
. Register interface for bandwidth usage monitoring. The bandwidth
  usage monitoring register interface is specified in <<BC_QOS>>.

The capacity and bandwidth controller register interfaces for resource
allocation and usage monitoring are defined as memory-mapped registers. Each
controller that supports CBQRI provides a set of registers that are located at a
range of physical address space that is a multiple of 4-KiB and the lowest
address of the range is aligned to 4-KiB. The memory-mapped registers may be
accessed using naturally aligned 4-byte or 8-byte memory accesses. The
controller behavior for register accesses where the address is not aligned to
the size of the access, or if the access spans multiple registers, of if the
size of the access is not 4-bytes or 8-bytes, is `UNSPECIFIED`. The atomicity of
access to an 8-byte register is `UNSPECIFIED`. The implementation may observe
the 8-byte access as two 4-byte accesses. A 4-byte access to a register must be
single-copy atomic.

[NOTE]
====
If an implementation may observe a 8-byte register access as two 4-byte
accesses then such implementations must preserve the semantics of the 8-byte
access and must cause any effects of the access after both accesses have been
observed.
====

The controller registers have little-endian byte order (even for systems where
all harts are big-endian-only).

[NOTE]
====
Big-endian-configured harts that make use of the register interface are
expected to implement the `REV8` byte-reversal instruction defined by the Zbb
extension. If `REV8` is not implemented, then endianness conversion may be
implemented using a sequence of instructions.
====

A controller may support a subset of capabilities defined by CBQRI. When a 
capability is not supported the registers and/or fields used to configure and/or
control such capabilities are hardwired to 0. Each controller supports a
capabilities register to enumerate the supported capabilities.
