[[BC_QOS]]
== Bandwidth-controller QoS Register Interface

Controllers, such as memory controllers, that support bandwidth allocation and
bandwidth usage monitoring provide a memory-mapped bandwidth-controller QoS
register interface.

The reset value is 0 for the following register fields.

* `bc_mon_ctl.BUSY` field
* `bc_alloc_ctl.BUSY` field

The reset value is `UNSPECIFIED` for all other register fields.

The bandwidth controllers at reset must allocate all available bandwidth to
`RCID` value of 0. When the bandwidth controller supports bandwidth allocation
per access-type, the access-type value of 0 of `RCID=0` is allocated all
available bandwidth, while all other access-types associated with that `RCID`
share the bandwidth allocation with `AT=0`. The bandwidth allocation for all
other `RCID` values is `UNSPECIFIED`. The bandwidth controller behavior in
handling a request with a non-zero `RCID` value before configuring the bandwidth
controller with bandwidth allocation for that `RCID` is also `UNSPECIFIED`.

[[BC_CAP]]
=== Bandwidth-controller Capabilities

The `bc_capabilities` register is a read-only register that holds the
bandwidth-controller capabilities.

.Bandwidth-controller Capabilities Register
[wavedrom, , ]
....
{reg: [
  {bits:  8, name: 'VER'},
  {bits: 16, name: 'NBWBLKS'},
  {bits:  1, name: 'RPFX'},
  {bits:  4, name: 'P'},
  {bits:  3, name: 'WPRI'},
  {bits: 16, name: 'MRBWB'},
  {bits: 16, name: 'WPRI'},
], config:{lanes: 4, hspace:1024}}
....

<<<

The `VER` field holds the version of the specification implemented by the
bandwidth controller. The low nibble is used to hold the minor version of the
specification and the upper nibble is used to hold the major version of the
specification. For example, an implementation that supports version 1.0 of the
specification reports `0x10`.

The `NBWBLKS` field holds the total number of available bandwidth blocks in 
the controller. The bandwidth represented by each bandwidth block is
`UNSPECIFIED`. The bandwidth controller supports reserving bandwidth in
multiples of a bandwidth block, which enables proportional allocation of
bandwidth.

Bandwidth controllers can limit the maximum bandwidth that can be reserved to
a value smaller than the `NBWBLKS` value. The `MRBWB` field reports the maximum number of
bandwidth blocks that can be reserved.

[NOTE]
====
The bandwidth controller meters the bandwidth usage by a workload to
determine if it is exceeding its allocations and, if necessary, take 
measures to throttle the workload's bandwidth usage. Therefore, the instantaneous
bandwidth used by a workload either exceeds or falls short of the configured
allocation. QoS capabilities are statistical in nature and are typically
designed to enforce the configured bandwidth over larger time windows. By not
allowing all available bandwidth blocks to be reserved for allocation, the
bandwidth controller can handle such transient inaccuracies.
====

When the `RCID`-prefixed mode (`RPFX`) is 1, the controller operates in `RPFX` 
mode. The parameter `P` (prefixed bits) indicates the number of least significant 
bits of the `MCID` carried in the request that should be prefixed by the RCID. The 
controller uses `RCID` in the requests along with `P` number of least significant 
bits of the `MCID` to compute an effective `MCID` (<<EMCID>>). This `MCID` is used 
to identify the monitoring counter. Legal values of `P` range from 0 to 12. 

If `RPFX` is 0, `P` is set to 0, and the effective `MCID` is the same as the `MCID` 
in the request.

[[BC_MCTL]]
=== Bandwidth Usage Monitoring Control

The `bc_mon_ctl` register controls the monitoring of bandwidth usage by a
`MCID`. When the controller does not support bandwidth usage monitoring, the
`bc_mon_ctl` register is read-only zero.

.Bandwidth Usage Monitoring Control Register (`bc_mon_ctl`)
[wavedrom, , ]
....
{reg: [
  {bits:  5, name: 'OP'},
  {bits:  3, name: 'AT'},
  {bits: 12, name: 'MCID'},
  {bits:  8, name: 'EVT_ID'},
  {bits:  1, name: 'ATV'},
  {bits:  3, name: 'WPRI'},
  {bits:  7, name: 'STATUS'},
  {bits:  1, name: 'BUSY'},
  {bits: 24, name: 'WPRI'},
], config:{lanes: 2, hspace:1024}}
....

Bandwidth controllers that support bandwidth usage monitoring implement a usage
monitoring counter for each supported `MCID`. The usage monitoring counter might
be configured to count a monitoring event. When an event matching the event
configured for the `MCID` occurs, then the monitoring counter is updated. The
event matching can optionally be filtered by the access-type. The monitoring 
counter for bandwidth usage counts the number of bytes transferred by requests
matching the monitoring event as the requests go past the monitoring point.

The `OP`, `AT`, `MCID`, and `EVT_ID` fields of the register are WARL fields.

The `OP` field is used to instruct the controller to perform an operation
listed in <<BC_MON_OP>>.

|===

When the `EVT_ID` for a `MCID` is programmed with a non-zero and legal value,
the counter is reset to 0 and starts counting matching events for requests with
the matching `MCID` and `AT` (if `ATV` is 1). However, if the `EVT_ID` is
configured as 0, the counter stops counting.

A controller that does not support monitoring by access-type can hardwire the
`ATV` and the `AT` fields to 0, indicating that the counter counts requests with
all access-types.

When the `bc_mon_ctl` register is written, the controller may need to perform
several actions that may not complete synchronously with the write. A write to
the `bc_mon_ctl` register sets the read-only `BUSY` bit to 1, indicating that the 
controller is performing the requested operation. When the `BUSY` bit reads 0, the
operation is complete, and the read-only `STATUS` field provides a status value
(see <<BC_MON_STS>> for details). Written values to the `BUSY` and the `STATUS`
fields are ignored. An implementation that can complete the operation
synchronously with the write may hardwire the `BUSY` bit to 0. The state of the
`BUSY` bit, when not hardwired to 0, shall only change in response to a write to
the register. The `STATUS` field remains valid until a subsequent write to the
`bc_mon_ctl` register.

When the `BUSY` bit is set to 1, the behavior of writes to the `bc_mon_ctl` is
`UNSPECIFIED`. Some implementations may ignore the second write, while others
may perform the operation determined by the second write. To ensure proper
operation, software must first verify that the `BUSY` bit is 0 before writing
the `bc_mon_ctl` register.

[[BC_MCTR]]
=== Bandwidth Monitoring Counter Value

The `bc_mon_ctr_val` is a read-only register that holds a snapshot of the
counter selected by a `READ_COUNTER` operation. When the controller does not
support bandwidth usage monitoring, the `bc_mon_ctr_val` register always reads
as zero.

.Bandwidth Monitoring Counter Value Register (`bc_mon_ctr_val`)
[wavedrom, , ]
....
{reg: [
  {bits:  62, name: 'CTR'},
  {bits:   1, name: 'INV'},
  {bits:   1, name: 'OVF'},
], config:{lanes: 2, hspace:1024}}
....

The counter is valid if the `INV` field is 0. The counter may be marked
`INV` if, for `UNSPECIFIED` reasons, the controller determines the count to be
not valid. Such counters may become valid in the future. Additionally, if an
unsigned integer overflow of the counter occurs, then the `OVF` bit is set to 1.

[NOTE]
====
A counter may be marked as `INV` if the controller has not been able to 
establish an accurate counter value for the monitored event.
====

The counter provides the number of bytes transferred by requests matching the
`EVT_ID` as they go past the monitoring point. A bandwidth value may be
determined by reading the byte count value at two instances of time `T1` and
`T2`. If the value of the counter at time `T1` was `B1`, and at time `T2` is
`B2`, then the bandwidth can be calculated using <<eq-3>>. The frequency of the
time source is represented by latexmath:[T_{freq}].

[latexmath#eq-3,reftext="equation ({counter:eqs})"]
++++
\begin{equation}
Bandwidth = T_{freq} \times \frac{ B2 - B1 }{T2 - T1}
\end{equation}
++++

The width of the counter is `UNSPECIFIED` but the unimplemented bits must be
read-only zero. 

[NOTE]
====
While the width of the counter is `UNSPECIFIED`, it is recommended to be wide
enough to prevent more than one overflow per sample when the sampling frequency
is 1 Hz.

If an overflow was detected then software may discard that sample and reset the
counter and overflow indication by reprogramming the event using `CONFIG_EVENT`
operation.
====

[[BC_ALLOC]]
=== Bandwidth Allocation Control

The `bc_alloc_ctl` register is used to control the allocation of bandwidth to an
`RCID` per `AT`. If a controller does not support bandwidth allocation, then the
register is read-only zero. If the controller does not support bandwidth
allocation per access-type, then the `AT` field is read-only zero.

.Bandwidth Allocation Control Register (`bc_alloc_ctl`)

The `OP` field instructs the bandwidth controller to perform an operation listed
in <<BC_ALLOC_OP>>. The `bc_alloc_ctl` register is used in conjunction with the
`bc_bw_alloc` register to perform bandwidth allocation operations. If the
requested operation uses the operands configured in `bc_bw_alloc`, software must
first program the `bc_bw_alloc` register with the operands for the operation
before requesting the operation.

<<<

A bandwidth allocation must be configured for each access-type supported by 
the controller. When differentiated bandwidth allocation based on access-type
is not required, one of the access-types may be designated to hold a default
bandwidth allocation, and the other access-types can be configured to share the
allocation with the default access-type. If bandwidth is not allocated for each 
access-type supported by the controller, the behavior is `UNSPECIFIED`.

When the `bc_alloc_ctl` register is written, the controller may need to perform
several actions that may not complete synchronously with the write. A write to
the `bc_alloc_ctl` sets the read-only `BUSY` bit to 1 indicating the controller
is performing the requested operation. When the `BUSY` bit reads 0, the operation

[[BC_BMASK]]
=== Bandwidth Allocation Configuration

The `bc_bw_alloc` is used to program reserved bandwidth blocks (`Rbwb`) for an
`RCID` for requests of access-type `AT` using the `CONFIG_LIMIT` operation. If a
controller does not support bandwidth allocation, then the `bc_bw_alloc` register
is read-only zero.

The `bc_bw_alloc` holds the previously configured reserved bandwidth blocks for
an `RCID` and `AT` on successful completion of the `READ_LIMIT` operation.

Bandwidth is allocated in multiples of bandwidth blocks, and the value in `Rbwb`
must be at least 1 and must not exceed `MRBWB` value. Otherwise, the `CONFIG_LIMIT`
operation fails with `STATUS=5`. Additionally, the sum of `Rbwb` allocated
across all `RCIDs` must not exceed `MRBWB` value, or the `CONFIG_LIMIT` operation
fails with `STATUS=5`.

.Bandwidth Allocation Configuration Register (`bc_bw_alloc`)
[wavedrom, , ]
....
{reg: [
  {bits: 16, name: 'Rbwb'},
  {bits:  4, name: 'WPRI'},
  {bits:  8, name: 'Mweight'},
  {bits:  3, name: 'sharedAT'},
  {bits:  1, name: 'useShared'},
  {bits: 32, name: 'WPRI'},
], config:{lanes: 4, hspace:1024}}
....

The `Rbwb`, `Mweight`, `sharedAT`, and `useShared` are all WARL fields.

Bandwidth allocation is typically enforced by the bandwidth controller over
finite accounting windows. The process involves measuring the bandwidth
consumption over an accounting window and determining if an `RCID` is exceeding 
its bandwidth allocations for each access-types. The specifics of how the 
accounting window is implemented are `UNSPECIFIED`, but is expected to provide 
a statistically accurate control of the bandwidth usage over a few accounting 
intervals.

The `Rbwb` field represents the bandwidth that is made available to an `RCID` for
requests that match `AT`, even when all other `RCID` are using their full
allocation of bandwidth. The bandwidth allocation scales linearly with the
number of bandwidth blocks programmed into `Rbwb`.

If there is non-reserved or unused bandwidth available in an accounting
interval, `RCIDs` may compete for additional bandwidth. The non-reserved or
unused bandwidth is proportionately shared among the competing `RCIDs` by using the
configured `Mweight` parameter, which is a number between 0 and 255. A larger
weight implies a greater fraction of the bandwidth. A weight of 0 implies that
the configured limit is a hard limit, and the use of unused or non-reserved
bandwidth is not allowed.

Sharing of non-reserved bandwidth is not differentiated by access-type identifier.
Therefore, the `Mweight` parameter must be programmed identically for all
access-type identifiers. If this parameter is programmed differently for each access-type 
identifier, then the controller can use the parameter configured for any of the
identifiers, but the behavior is otherwise well defined.

When the `Mweight` parameter is not set to 0, the amount of unused bandwidth
allocated to `RCID=x` during contention with another `RCID` that is also
permitted to use unused bandwidth is determined by dividing the `Mweight` of
`RCID=x` by the sum of the `Mweight` of all other contending `RCIDs`. This
ratio `P` is determined by <<eq-4>>.

[latexmath#eq-4,reftext="equation ({counter:eqs})"]
++++
\begin{equation}
P = \frac{Mweight_{x}}{\sum_{r=1}^{r=n} Mweight_{r}}
\end{equation}
++++

[NOTE]
====
The bandwidth enforcement is typically work-conserving, allowing unused bandwidth 
 to be used by requestors that are enabled to use it, even if they have
consumed their `Rbwb` allotment.

When contending for unused bandwidth, the weighted share is typically 
computed among the `RCIDs` that are actively generating requests in that
accounting interval and have a non-zero weight programmed.
====

If unique bandwidth allocation is not required for an access-type identifier, then the
`useShared` parameter can be set to 1 for a `CONFIG_LIMIT` operation. When
`useShared` is set to 1, the `sharedAT` field specifies the access-type identifer with
which the bandwidth allocation is shared by the access-type identifier in
`bc_alloc_ctl.AT`. In this case, the `Rbwb` and `Mweight` fields are ignored,
and the configurations of the access-type identifier in `sharedAT` are applied. If the
access-type identifier specified by `sharedAT` does not have unique bandwidth allocation,
meaning that it has not been configured with `useShared=0`, then the behavior
is `UNSPECIFIED`.

The `useShared` and `sharedAT` fields are read-only zero if the bandwidth
controller does not support bandwidth allocation per access-type identifier.

[NOTE]
====
When unique bandwidth allocation for an access-type identifier is not required, then one or
more identifiers might be configured with a shared bandwidth allocation. For
example, consider a bandwidth controller that supports 3 access-type identifers. The
access-type identifier 0 and 1 of `RCID` 3 are configured with unique bandwidth allocations
and the access-type identifier 2 is configured to share bandwidth allocation with
identifier 1. The example configuration is illustrated in the following table:
